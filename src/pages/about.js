      <h1>Synopsis</h1>

      <p>AD. 2017 The last era in which Magecraft still existed.</p>
      <p>
        Society was created by human hands, but Mages grasped the truth of the
        world. Magecraft is comprised of techniques from past humans that cannot
        be explained by science, while science encompasses the techniques of
        future humans that Magecraft cannot achieve.
      </p>
      <p>
        Researchers and scholars of both Magecraft and science have been
        gathered to maintain human civilization.
      </p>

      <p>
        It was then, in 2017... Without warning, the future domain recorded by
        Sheba vanished. Calculations identified proved the extinction of
        humanity in 2019.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sheba detected a new abnormality. AD. 2004. A certain provincial town in
        Japan. For the first time ever, a region that could not be observed
        appeared.
      </p>
      <p>
        Assuming that this was the cause of humanityâ€™s extinction, Chaldea
        carried out its sixth experiment, though it was still untested. Time
        travel into the past. A forbidden ceremony where they would convert
        Mages into Spiritrons and send them back in time. By intervening in
        events, they would locate, identify, and destroy the space-time
        Singularities.
      </p>
      <p>They called the mission the Quest for the Holy Grail: Grand Order.</p>
      <p>
        This is the title for those who would make a stand against human
        history, and battle fate in order to protect humanity.
